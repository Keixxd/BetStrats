BetStrats

Interview task - make an app with bet strategies that can be added to favorite and also read more about certain strategy.
App is built on Room, MVVM, SingleActivity and Clean Architecture that makes it's code more readable and scalable. All pictures that have been used are just placeholders, 
you can simply add an api call to fetch some pictures, or even some stratagies.

There are only three screens in this app.
First - HomeFragment. It displays all strategies, which can be added to favorite or readed.
